### Capstone Project: Battle of the Neighborhoods
This project is a part of the **_IBM Data Science Specialization_** course where we learned what data scientists go through in real life when working with data. In this project I shall define a business problem, scrape data from the web and with the skills of a data scientist, create a compelling narrative from the data. Our tools for this project will be **_density-based clustering_** using **_K-means algorithm_** and other machine learning techniques. In this project, I shall provide a step-by-step description of the processes involved starting from defining the business problem, data preparation and the techniques that forge the data to create a final analysis. The project ends with a conclusion section which can be leveraged by business stakeholders to make decisions.
